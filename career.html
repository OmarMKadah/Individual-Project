          <p>While attending East Tennessee State University, working a part-time job was a necessity to sustain an independent living. I applied for a seasonal opening in preperation for Black Friday and holiday sales. Little did I know, this company opened doors in ways that I never imagined. While not knowing (like many other students) <em>exactly</em> what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Started my career with this company in 2011 as a Computer Sales associate. I've always had an interest in computers, PC gaming, and many other electronics, and I was passionate about sales. It was a good feeling being able to help others decide what computers or electronics they needed, and being able to work closely to the community had perks of their own. Since employment with this company, I've held positions in multiple departments including:
          <li>Computers/Tablets</li>
          <li>Best Buy Mobile</li>
          <li>Geek Squad</li>
