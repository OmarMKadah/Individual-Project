          <p>While growing up in Virginia, where the climate was much different than upstate New York, my mother developed a <span style="color:green">Green</span> thumb. She would love to plants herb and vegetables that did well in the area, and also offered fresh year round supply. Herbs such as mint, cilantro, basil, etc. were all apart of the garden. My brothers and I would help out in transplanting cuts, harvesting or feeding. I found the progress of simple garden bed farming to be amazing and would involve myself as much as I could. As for my brothers this was not the case; leaving me with more work to do. I carried this enviorment with me when my girlfriend and I purchase our home in Lyons, Oregon</p>
