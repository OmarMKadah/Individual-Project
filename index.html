          <p> I was born in the fall of 1991 in Syracuse, NY. Since living NY I've lived in several cities and states including:
            <li>Buffalo, New York</li>
            <li>Vienna, Virginia</li>
            <li>Atlanta, Georgia</li>
            <li>Johnson City, Tennessee</li>
            <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
            <li>Lyons, Oregon</li></p>
          <p> Living in several regions in the United has been an incredibly eye opening experience, and immersing myelf in different cultures, values, and political ideoligies has strengthened my understanding and acceptance of others. The U.S has a culmination of differences and being able to experience all of these first hand has made me who I am today. From living in some of the largest cities to smalles towns in the U.S, I've picked up hobbies and cultural values along the way. </p>
          <p> Prior to entering grade school, the first language I learned was <em>Arabic</em>. Being able to speak two languages has had a pivitol role in my upbringing. Although it didn't feel impactful during, say, kindergarten, once I vegan moving to different cities, I was able to relate closer to Arab-Americans whether they were first-generation, second, etc.</p>
